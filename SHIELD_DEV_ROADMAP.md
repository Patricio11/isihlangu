# SHIELD (ISIHLANGU) - DESIGN-FIRST ROADMAP
**Strategy:** "Frontend First." Build the Ferrari body before putting in the engine.
**Goal:** Create a visually stunning, award-winning UI with mock data to prove the UX concept.

---

## PHASE 1: THE "AWARD-WINNING" UI ✅ COMPLETE
*Goal: A fully interactive app with hardcoded data. It looks real, but logic is mocked.*
*Status: COMPLETED - 2025-12-09*

### Task 1.1: The Design System (The "DNA") ✅
- [x] Install `flutter_animate`, `glassmorphism`, `google_fonts` (Outfit), `lottie`, `gap`, `sensors_plus`, `intl`.
- [x] Create `AppTheme` class: Define the "Deep Slate" background and "Neon Teal" gradients.
- [x] Build the **"GlassContainer"** reusable widget (frosted blur effect).
- [x] Build the **"NeonButton"** reusable widgets (glows on press).

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/core/theme/app_colors.dart` - Complete color palette with gradients and glows
- `lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart` - ThemeData with Outfit font family
- `lib/core/widgets/glass_container.dart` - Glass morphism components (GlassContainer, GlassButton, CircularGlassButton, GlassCard)
- `lib/core/widgets/animated_mesh_gradient.dart` - Animated background gradient

### Task 1.2: The "Stealth" Login Screen ✅
- [x] Build a biometric-style login page.
- [x] **Animation:** Create the "Mesh Gradient" background that moves slowly (breathing effect).
- [x] **Interaction:** Build the PIN pad.
    - *Mock Logic:* If PIN '1234' → Go to Home (Safe). If PIN '9999' → Go to Home (Duress).
    - *Visual:* Ensure the transition is identical for both.
- [x] **Security:** Session-based scope system (Admin/Restricted) prepared for Phase 2.

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/login_screen.dart` - Main login UI with animations
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/pin_dots.dart` - 4-dot PIN indicator with glow
- `lib/features/auth/presentation/widgets/pin_keypad.dart` - Glass-style keypad
- `lib/features/auth/domain/auth_state.dart` - Authentication state model

- `lib/features/auth/providers/session_provider.dart` - Session management

**Test PINs:**
- `1234` → Safe Mode (Admin scope, full access)
- `9999` → Duress Mode (Restricted scope, fake balance)

### Task 1.3: The Home Dashboard (The "Wow" Factor) ✅
- [x] Build the **"Gyroscope Card"**: The credit card tilts slightly as you move the phone.
- [x] Build the **"Pulse Indicator"**: A glowing green ring around the shield icon.
- [x] Build the **"Staggered List"**: Transaction history slides in one-by-one.
- [x] **Mock Data:** Create a `fake_transactions.dart` file to populate the list.
- [x] **Circular Action Buttons:** Pay, Top Up, Freeze, More.
- [x] **Greeting Header:** Time-based greeting with user name.

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/features/home/presentation/home_screen.dart` - Main dashboard

**Data:**
- Safe Mode: R 12,450.50 balance | 8 transactions
- Duress Mode: R 150.00 balance | 3 transactions

### Task 1.4: The "Panic" UX ✅
- [x] **The Transition:** When logging in with '9999', show restricted UI.
- [x] **The Trap:** Show a fake balance (R 150.00).
- [x] **The Trigger:** Show a "Silent Alert Sent" toast message (only for testing).
- [x] **Feature Restrictions:** Disable Top Up and Freeze buttons in Duress Mode.
- [x] **Safety Center:** Show "Access Restricted" for duress users.

**Security Implementation:**

## PHASE 1.6: THE "SECURITY SIMULATION" (CRITICAL DURESS LOGIC) 🚧 IN PROGRESS
*Goal: Simulate the sophisticated "Duress" logic locally so the UX can be fully demonstrated before backend integration.*
*Status: ACTIVE - Week 2*
*Started: 2025-12-10*

**Strategic Importance:**
This phase implements the CORE security simulation that makes Shield unique:
1. **Sacrificial Wallet Protocol** - Transactions under R200 succeed in duress mode
2. **Persistent Lockdown** - App stays in duress mode even after restart (reboot-proof)
3. **Parent Remote Unlock** - Only parents can restore safe mode
4. **Permission Priming** - Critical permissions granted during onboarding (not during duress)

---

### Task 1.6.1: "Sacrificial Wallet" Simulation ⏳
**Priority:** CRITICAL - This is the core security innovation

- [ ] **Ghost Wallet Data Structure:**
    - [ ] Create `lib/core/data/fake_ghost_wallet.dart`
    - [ ] Define ghost balance: R185.50 (appears authentic, covers small purchases)
    - [ ] Create 3-5 fake transactions for ghost history
    - [ ] Ensure ghost data looks realistic to attackers

- [ ] **Transaction Success Logic (Under R200):**
    - [ ] Update PayScreen to check duress mode status
    - [ ] If duress + amount < R200:
        - [ ] Show normal success animation
        - [ ] Update ghost balance (visual only)
        - [ ] Add subtle "Evidence Recorded" indicator (tiny dot in corner)
        - [ ] Log transaction details to mock evidence log
    - [ ] Transaction appears completely normal to attacker

- [ ] **Transaction Block Logic (Over R200):**
    - [ ] If duress + amount >= R200:
        - [ ] Show realistic "Network Error" dialog
        - [ ] Error message: "Unable to connect. Please try again later."
        - [ ] NO mention of limits or restrictions
        - [ ] Identical timing to real network errors (2-3 second delay)

- [ ] **Evidence Recording (Silent):**
    - [ ] Create `lib/core/security/evidence_logger.dart`
    - [ ] Log all duress transactions with:
        - [ ] Timestamp
        - [ ] Amount
        - [ ] Recipient details
        - [ ] Device location (if available)
    - [ ] Store in local encrypted storage (mock Phase 2 backend)
    - [ ] NO visible indicators to attacker

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/core/data/fake_ghost_wallet.dart` - Ghost wallet data
- `lib/core/security/evidence_logger.dart` - Evidence recording service
- `lib/core/security/transaction_validator.dart` - R200 limit logic
- Updated `lib/features/payment/presentation/pay_screen.dart` - Duress-aware transactions

**Mock Data:**
```dart
// Ghost Wallet
balance: R185.50
recent_transactions: [
  "Shoprite - R42.50 (Yesterday)",
  "Taxi Fare - R15.00 (2 days ago)",
  "Airtime - R30.00 (3 days ago)"
]
```

---

### Task 1.6.2: Persistent Ghost Mode ("The Trap Door") ⏳
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Prevents attacker from resetting app

- [ ] **Duress State Persistence:**
    - [ ] Install `shared_preferences` package (if not already installed)
    - [ ] Create `lib/core/security/duress_state_manager.dart`
    - [ ] Store `is_in_duress` boolean flag
    - [ ] Store `duress_entered_at` timestamp
    - [ ] Store `user_id` who entered duress mode

- [ ] **App Startup Logic (Reboot-Proof):**
    - [ ] Update `lib/main.dart`:
        - [ ] Check `is_in_duress` flag on app init
        - [ ] If `true`, bypass normal auth flow
        - [ ] Navigate directly to HomeScreen with duress data
        - [ ] Show ghost balance immediately
        - [ ] NO escape route for user

- [ ] **Session Restoration:**
    - [ ] If duress flag active:
        - [ ] Create session with `isRestricted: true`
        - [ ] Load user profile from stored `user_id`
        - [ ] Initialize ghost wallet data
        - [ ] Start evidence logging service

- [ ] **Security Considerations:**
    - [ ] Flag stored in secure storage (encrypted)
    - [ ] Cannot be cleared by app uninstall (prepare for cloud sync in Phase 2)
    - [ ] User cannot access settings to clear data in duress mode

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/core/security/duress_state_manager.dart` - Persistent state service
- Updated `lib/main.dart` - Startup duress check
- Updated `lib/features/auth/providers/session_provider.dart` - Session restoration

**Mock Flow:**
```
1. User enters PIN 9999 → Duress flag set to TRUE
2. Attacker forces phone restart
3. App opens → Checks flag → Flag is TRUE
4. App bypasses login → Shows ghost dashboard immediately
5. User CANNOT exit duress mode (trapped)
```

---

### Task 1.6.3: Parent Remote Unlock (Mock Safety Override) ⏳
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for testing and real-world safety

- [ ] **Parent Dashboard Addition:**
    - [ ] Update `lib/features/family/presentation/child_control_panel_screen.dart`
    - [ ] Add "Safety Status" section at the top
    - [ ] Show current status: "Safe Mode ✅" or "DURESS MODE 🚨"
    - [ ] Add "Reset to Safe Mode" button (only visible if child in duress)

- [ ] **Remote Unlock Logic:**
    - [ ] Button triggers `DuressStateManager.clearDuressState(childId)`
    - [ ] Clears `is_in_duress` flag for that child
    - [ ] Sends notification to child device (mock push notification)
    - [ ] Next time child opens app → Normal login flow resumes

- [ ] **Parent Notification:**
    - [ ] When child enters duress mode:
        - [ ] Immediately show banner on parent's home screen
        - [ ] "⚠️ [Child Name] entered Duress Mode [Time]"
        - [ ] Show child's last known location (mock GPS)
        - [ ] Provide quick access to "Mark Safe" button

- [ ] **Confirmation Flow:**
    - [ ] Parent taps "Reset to Safe Mode"
    - [ ] Show confirmation dialog:
        - [ ] "Are you sure [Child Name] is safe?"
        - [ ] Require parent PIN re-entry for security
    - [ ] Success toast: "[Child Name] marked as safe. Status cleared."

**Deliverables:**
- Updated `lib/features/family/presentation/child_control_panel_screen.dart` - Safety controls
- `lib/features/family/presentation/widgets/duress_status_banner.dart` - Alert banner
- Updated `lib/core/security/duress_state_manager.dart` - Remote clear method
- `lib/core/notifications/duress_alert_service.dart` - Parent notifications

**Mock Implementation:**
```dart
// Parent sees:
DuressStatusBanner(
  child: "Lesedi",
  enteredAt: DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(minutes: 15)),
  lastLocation: "School - 2.3 km away",
  onMarkSafe: () => DuressStateManager.clearDuressState("child-1"),
)
```

---

### Task 1.6.4: The "Permission Gotcha" (Critical Onboarding) ⏳ ⚠️
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Permissions MUST be granted before duress event

**Security Principle:**
> If we ask for Location/Microphone permissions DURING a duress event, the OS permission dialog will alert the attacker. We MUST obtain these permissions during the "happy path" onboarding when everything seems normal.

- [ ] **Permission Requirements Analysis:**
    - [ ] Location: "Always Allow" (background tracking in duress)
    - [ ] Microphone: "Allow" (audio evidence recording)
    - [ ] Camera: "Allow" (optional - for evidence photos)
    - [ ] Notifications: "Allow" (parent alerts)

- [ ] **Onboarding Screen Addition:**
    - [ ] Create `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/permission_prime_screen.dart`
    - [ ] Position AFTER role selection, BEFORE PIN setup
    - [ ] Title: "Safety Features Setup"
    - [ ] Explanation: "Shield protects you in emergencies by:"
        - [ ] "📍 Tracking your location if you need help"
        - [ ] "🔊 Recording evidence if forced to use your account"
        - [ ] "🚨 Alerting your family instantly"

- [ ] **Permission Request Flow:**
    - [ ] Use `permission_handler` package
    - [ ] Request each permission with context:
        - [ ] "We need location access to protect you in emergencies"
        - [ ] "We need microphone access to record evidence if needed"
    - [ ] BLOCK onboarding progress until ALL critical permissions granted
    - [ ] Show "Skip for now" option (but warn: "Emergency features won't work")

- [ ] **Permission Status Checking:**
    - [ ] Create `lib/core/security/permission_validator.dart`
    - [ ] Check all permissions on app launch
    - [ ] If revoked later:
        - [ ] Show banner: "⚠️ Emergency features disabled. Re-enable permissions?"
        - [ ] Provide quick access to system settings

- [ ] **Testing Scenarios:**
    - [ ] User grants all permissions → Onboarding continues
    - [ ] User denies location → Warning shown, can proceed with limitations
    - [ ] User revokes permissions later → Banner appears on home screen

**Deliverables:**
- `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/permission_prime_screen.dart` - Permission education
- `lib/core/security/permission_validator.dart` - Permission checking service
- Updated `lib/features/onboarding/presentation/onboarding_screen.dart` - Add permission step
- Updated `lib/core/navigation/app_router.dart` - Permission screen route

**Dependencies:**
```yaml
# Add to pubspec.yaml
permission_handler: ^11.0.0
geolocator: ^10.1.0
record: ^5.0.0  # For audio recording
```

**Mock UI Flow:**
```
1. Splash Screen
2. Onboarding Carousel (3 slides)
3. Role Selection (Parent/Child)
4. → Permission Prime Screen (NEW) ←
5. PIN Setup
6. Duress PIN Education
7. Home Screen
```

- [ ] User cannot self-exit duress mode

**Parent Override:**
- [ ] Parent sees duress status in control panel
- [ ] Parent can mark child as safe
- [ ] Duress flag clears remotely
- [ ] Child receives notification
- [ ] Normal login flow resumes

**Permission Priming:**
- [ ] Permission screen added to onboarding
- [ ] Location "Always Allow" requested
- [ ] Microphone access requested
- [ ] Onboarding blocked until granted
- [ ] Permission status validated on launch

## 🎯 WHY PHASE 1.6 IS CRITICAL

**Before Phase 2 Backend:**
We need to demonstrate the COMPLETE duress flow locally:

1. ✅ User enters duress PIN
2. ✅ App locks into ghost mode (reboot-proof)
3. ✅ Small transactions succeed (attacker satisfied)
4. ✅ Large transactions blocked (funds protected)
5. ✅ Evidence logged silently (legal protection)
6. ✅ Parent can remotely unlock (safety override)

**This phase proves the concept works BEFORE we build the expensive backend infrastructure.**

**Priority:** CRITICAL PATH TO PHASE 2
**Dependencies:** Phase 1.5 ✅ Complete
**Blocks:** Phase 2 (Supabase Integration)
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

## PHASE 2: WIRING THE BRAIN (Supabase & Security Core)
*Goal: Connect Supabase, implement the Dual-Ledger System, and finalize Role-Based Security.*
*Status: READY TO START*

### Task 2.1: Supabase Schema Architecture (The Foundation)
- [ ] Set up Supabase project & environment variables.
- [ ] **Core Tables Implementation:**
    - [ ] `profiles`: Extends auth with `role` (Parent/Child), `family_id`, and `safety_status` ('SAFE'/'DURESS').
    - [ ] `families`: Groups users together (Parent ownership logic).
    - [ ] `wallets`: Supports multi-types: `main_wallet` (Real), `savings_wallet`, and `ghost_wallet` (The Sacrificial Ledger).
    - [ ] `peer_permissions`: Stores the toggles from the Parent Control Panel (can_view_balance, daily_limits, etc.).
- [ ] **Security Tables:**
    - [ ] `emergency_logs`: Stores evidence (GPS coords, Audio URLs) - **Insert Only** for Child roles.
    - [ ] `fraud_reports`: Auto-flags the recipient of a sacrificial transaction.

### Task 2.2: Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- [ ] **Parent Policy:** Can `SELECT/UPDATE` all tables where `family_id` matches their own.
- [ ] **Child (Safe) Policy:** Can `SELECT` own data. Can `SELECT` family data *only if* `peer_permissions` allow.
- [ ] **Duress Policy (The Iron Curtain):**
    - [ ] If `safety_status == 'DURESS'`:
        - [ ] Can **ONLY** read `ghost_wallet`.
        - [ ] Can **ONLY** insert into `emergency_logs`.
        - [ ] **BLOCK** access to `main_wallet` and `savings_wallet`.

### Task 2.3: Edge Functions (The Logic Layer)
- [ ] **Function: `validate_pin_and_scope`**
    - [ ] Input: PIN.
    - [ ] Logic: Checks PIN hash.
        - [ ] If Parent/Child PIN: Returns Session + `scope: safe`.
        - [ ] If Duress PIN: Returns Session + `scope: restricted` + Triggers `safety_status = 'DURESS'`.
- [ ] **Function: `process_sacrificial_transaction`**
    - [ ] Input: Amount, Recipient.
    - [ ] Logic:
        - [ ] If Amount < R200: Process successfully from `ghost_wallet`.
        - [ ] If Amount > R200: Throw fake "Network Error 504".
        - [ ] **Side Effect:** Log recipient details to `fraud_reports` immediately.
- [ ] **Function: `timing_mitigation`**
    - [ ] Ensure `validate_pin` takes exactly 1500ms for *both* Safe and Duress PINs to prevent "timing attacks" (guessing the PIN type by speed).

### Task 2.4: Realtime Telemetry & State
- [ ] **Family Sync:** Connect Riverpod to Supabase Streams for real-time balance updates (Parent Control Panel).
- [ ] **Safety Stream (The Lifeline):**
    - [ ] Implement `flutter_background_service`.
    - [ ] Logic: If `safety_status == 'DURESS'`, stream High-Accuracy GPS to `profiles` table every 10s.
    - [ ] **Parent Alert:** Parent App listens to `profiles`. If child's status changes to 'DURESS':
        - [ ] **Visual:** Trigger full-screen flashing Red Alarm Screen.
        - [ ] **Haptic/Audio:** Force continuous Vibration and Play Loud Alarm Ringtone (attempt to override device Silent Mode).


---

## PHASE 3: THE FAMILY ECONOMY (Weeks 5-6)
*Goal: Implement the "Parent Control" and "Gig Economy" features.*

### Task 3.1: The Parent "Control Panel"
- [ ] Build the **Peer Settings Screen** (Parent View).
- [ ] Implement Toggles:
    - [ ] `can_view_balance` (Show/Hide Piggy Bank).
    - [ ] `enable_tasks` (Unlock Chores).
    - [ ] `enable_loans` (Unlock Borrowing).
    - [ ] `lunch_mode` (Geo-fencing prep).
- [ ] **Logic:** Updating these toggles instantly updates the `peer_permissions` table.

### Task 3.2: The Gig Economy (Tasks & Bounties)
- [ ] **Parent UI:** "Create Bounty" screen (Title, Reward, Assignee).
- [ ] **Peer UI:** "Job Board" screen (List of available chores).
- [ ] **Logic:**
    - [ ] Peer clicks "Claim Task".
    - [ ] Peer clicks "Mark Complete" (Uploads photo).
    - [ ] Parent clicks "Approve" → **Trigger Transaction** (Move money from Parent Wallet to Child Wallet).

## PHASE 4: THE INTEGRATIONS & CARD LOGIC (Weeks 7-8)
*Goal: Connect to Real Banking APIs and Implement the "Unlock-to-Pay" Security.*

### Task 4.1: Vendor Selection & Integration
- [ ] **Due Diligence:** Evaluate APIs for Programmable Banking.
    - *Candidate A:* **Root (RootCode)** - Best for scriptable transaction logic.
    - *Candidate B:* **Stitch / Ukheshe** - Strong for card issuing and virtual wallets.
- [ ] Set up Sandbox Environment with chosen vendor.

### Task 4.2: The "Unlock-to-Pay" Logic (Core Security Feature)
*The physical/virtual card remains "Frozen" (Limit: R0.00) by default. It only unlocks via App PIN.*

- [ ] **Step 1: Default State Implementation**
    - [ ] Configure card issuer to set hard limit to R0.00 by default.
    - [ ] Ensure any transaction attempted without unlocking is instantly declined.

- [ ] **Step 2: The "Safe Unlock" Flow (PIN 1234)**
    - [ ] **User Action:** Enter PIN `1234` in App.
    - [ ] **Edge Function:** `unlock_card_safe()`
        - [ ] Increases Card Limit to Available Balance (or user-set daily limit).
        - [ ] Sets a **2-minute Timer**.
        - [ ] **UI:** Shows "Ready to Tap" countdown timer.
    - [ ] **After 2 Mins:** Function auto-resets Limit to R0.00.

- [ ] **Step 3: The "Duress Unlock" Flow (PIN 9999)**
    - [ ] **User Action:** Enter PIN `9999` in App.
    - [ ] **Edge Function:** `unlock_card_duress()`
        - [ ] Increases Card Limit to **R150.00 ONLY** (Lunch Money).
        - [ ] **Triggers Silent Alarm** (GPS + Push Notification to Parent).
        - [ ] **UI:** Shows "Ready to Tap" timer (Identical visual to Safe Mode).
        - [ ] **Scenario:** If user buys lunch (R50) → Approved. If user tries to buy TV (R5000) → Declined ("Insufficient Funds").

### Task 4.3: Location Intelligence (Lunch Mode)
- [ ] Add Google Maps widget to "Safety Center".
- [ ] **Geo-Fencing Logic:**
    - [ ] Define "School Zone" radius.
    - [ ] *Integration:* If using Root, inject logic: `if (transaction.location != school_zone) return decline;`
---

## PHASE 5: POLISH & SECURITY (Week 9+)
- [ ] Biometric Auth (FaceID/Fingerprint).
- [ ] Code Obfuscation & Penetration Testing.
- [ ] Beta testing with real families.
- [ ] Submit to App Stores.
